# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a lightweight alerting and notification system that enables administrators to create and manage alerts with configurable visibility, while providing end users with control over their notification preferences. The system implements recurring reminders every 2 hours until users snooze alerts, ensuring important notifications are not missed while maintaining user autonomy.
